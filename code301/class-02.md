#  jQuery, Events, and The DOM

## JQuery
p. 293-301
1. JQuery lets you find elements using CSS-style selectors and then do something with elements using jQuery methods.

`$('li.hot')` creates jQuery object. This function has one parameter (css-style selector)

2. Do something with the elements using jQuery methods

`$('li.hot').addClass('complete');`

- selecting elements is simpler and more accurate
- Event handeling is simpler, uses one method that works in all major browsers
- method affect all elements selecte ith having to loop through each one
- once you have made a selection, you can apply multiple methods to it

jQuery has methods that offer simpler ways to perform common tasks, like:
- loop throug elements
- add/remove elementsfrom the DOM tree
- Handle events
- Fade elements into/ out of view
- Handle Ajax requests
