# Node, Express, and APIs

> Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.

> Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

> Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. In other words, it’s a JavaScript runtime.

- create a new file hello.js
- copy in the following code:console.log("Hello, World!");
- run in terminal: node hello.js
- If Node.js is configured properly, “Hello, World!” will be displayed

In addition to being the package manager for JavaScript, npm is also the world’s largest software registry.

### What Is Node.js Used For?

To use any modern JavaScript framework (likeReact or Angular), you’ll be expected to have a working knowledge of Node and npm because these frameworks are all available via npm and rely on Node to create a sensible development environment in which they can run.

Node.js is:
- single-threaded
- event-driven (everything that happens in Node is in reaction to an event)
- uses the libuv library to implement this asynchronous (that is, non-blocking) behavior.
- capable of handling a large number of simultaneous connections

Node is particularly suited to building applications that require some form of real-time interaction or collaboration

### What Are the Advantages of Node.js?

- speed and scalability
- You can do everything in the same language
- it speaks JSON
