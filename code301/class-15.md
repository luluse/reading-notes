# Diversity and Inclusion

## Silicon Valley’s gender gap is the result of computer-game marketing 20 years ago

- In 2014, 70% of the employees at the top tech companies in Silicon Valley, such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter, were male
- only 10% of the technical workforce at Twitter is female.
- In 1984, 37% of computer science graduates were women. By 2016, that number had been whittled down to 18%.
- Marketing games: one of the primary reasons can be traced back to the close relationship between computing and gaming in the 1980s. “A lot of early computers were used for game playing”. “Those games tended to be more aimed more at boys and men, so it was easy for boys to get a leg up in that area through gaming.”
- “experience gap” in 1995. Men were more familiar with programming languages than women and were more likely to report having an “expert” level of programming proficiency before enrolling at Carnegie Mellon.
- Even when women do have considerable experience with coding and mathematics, the male-dominated environment that has arisen becomes an obstacle to entry for many.
- The Center for Talent Innovation, a research think tank, found that US women are 45% more likely than men to leave careers in technology. 
- women often feel isolated due to a lack of female role models and the sense of being excluded from “buddy networks” among men.
