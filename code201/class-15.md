# What Google Learned About Teams

Many of today’s most valuable firms have come to realize that analyzing and improving individual workers (known as ‘‘employee performance optimization’’) isn’t enough. As commerce becomes increasingly global and complex, the bulk of modern work is more and more team-based. 

> the time spent by managers and employees in collaborative activities has ballooned by 50 percent or more over the last two decades

studies show that groups tend to innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly and find better solutions to problems.

 Studies also show that people working in teams tend to achieve better results and report higher job satisfaction. 

In 2012, Google embarked on an initiative called Project Aristotle — to study hundreds of Google’s teams and figure out why some stumbled while others soared.

For Project Aristotle, research on psychological safety pointed to particular norms that are vital to success. There were other behaviors that seemed important as well — like making sure teams had clear goals and creating a culture of dependability. **But Google’s data indicated that psychological safety, more than anything else, was critical to making a team work.**
