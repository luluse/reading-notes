# Event Driven Applications

### Why is access control important?

- guarantees that users are who they say they are and that they have the appropriate access to company data
- access control is a selective restriction of access to data.
- businesses with employees who work out of the office and require access to the company data resources and services can be dangerous if not controlled.

### Describe an application that would need access control.

Canvas has an access control. Wether you are a student or teacher you have access to a different content.

### What is a role used for?
- assigning system access to users based on their role within an organization
- users grouped into roles based on common job responsibilities and system access needs. 
- Access is then assigned to each person based strictly on their role assignment. 
- With tight adherence to access requirements established for each role, access management becomes much easier.


### Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?

- RBAC grants access based on a user’s role and implements key security principles, such as “least privilege” and “separation of privilege.” Thus, someone attempting to access information can only access data that’s deemed necessary for their role.
- With the proper implementation of RBAC, the assignment of access rights becomes systematic and repeatable. Further, it is much easier to audit user rights, and to correct any issues identified.

| Term | Definition |

|Role Based Access Control | assigning system access to users based on their role within an organization |
|Capabilities |  A capability (known in some systems as a key) is a communicable, unforgeable token of authority. It refers to a value that references an object along with an associated set of access rights. |
