**What is the difference between a module and a package?**

A package is a file or directory that is described by a package.json file. A package must contain a package.json file in order to be published to the npm registry. A package is one or more modules (libraries) grouped (or packaged) together.

A modules is a librarie for Node.js. It is any file or directory in the node_modules directory that can be loaded by the Node.js require() function. 
    
Since modules are not required to have a package.json file, not all modules are packages. Only modules that have a package.json file are also packages.

**What does the node package manager do?**

- An online repository for the publishing of open-source Node.js projects
- A command-line utility for interacting with said repository that aids in package installation, version management, and dependency management.
