## [How to Solve Programming Problems](https://simpleprogrammer.com/solving-problems-breaking-it-down/)

- Read the problem completely twice. 
  - You want to make sure you completely understand the problem

- Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data. 
  - Make sure you really understand your solution and that it will work for more than one case. 
  - Don’t forget to look for corner cases and edge cases and do any examples for those kind of cases you can think of.
  - > “Nothing can be automated that cannot be done manually!”

- Optimize the manual steps.
  - figure out if there is another way you can solve the problem easier, or if there are some steps you can cut our or simplify.

- Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
  - capture all the steps we created and now either put them into our editor as comments or write them as psuedo-code that we can translate to real code

- Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
  - 1 for 1 translation of the comments we created above for real code.

- Optimize the real code.

> “The most successful people I know are not busy. They’re focused.”

- For world-class performers, busyness and stress are the enemy. They’re a sign you’re off-track. It means you’ve been lazy and undisciplined, and have let too many unimportant tasks take you away from what really matters.
- Extremely successful people don’t tolerate busywork or distraction. They have crystal clear vision on their goals, and do what they need to do to get there, every single day.
> “Busyness and exhaustion should be your enemy. If you’re chronically stressed and up late working, you’re doing something wrong. Do less. But do what you do with complete, hard focus. Then when you’re done be done, and go enjoy the rest of your day.”

- If you don’t treat yourself and your time with respect, you will become unhappy, resentful, and tired. 
- You probably need to say “no” more.


## [How to think like a programmer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-think-like-a-programmer-lessons-in-problem-solving-d1d8bf1de7d2/)

> It is about a more effective way for problem solving.

> Problem-solving skills are almost unanimously the most important qualification that employers look for. It is considered the meta-skill. 

The best way to solve problems involves having a framework and practicing it.

#### When you encounter a problem:
1. Understand: Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them (you should write down your problem, doodle a diagram, or tell someone else about it)

1. Plan: Give your brain time to analyze the problem and process the information. Don’t dive right into solving without a plan

1. Divide: break it into sub-problems that are easier to solve. Connecting all your “sub-solutions” will give you the solution to the original problem.

1. Stuck? best programmers/problem-solvers are more curious about bugs/errors than irritated.
    -  Debug: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong.
    - Reassess: Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective.
    - Research: Google is your best friend. No matter what problem you have, someone has probably solved it

#### Practise:

If you want to be a good problem-solver, solve a lot of problems!

Find an outlet to practice. Something that allows you to solve many micro-problems.
