## [How to Solve Programming Problems](https://simpleprogrammer.com/solving-problems-breaking-it-down/)

- Read the problem completely twice. 
  - You want to make sure you completely understand the problem

- Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data. 
  - Make sure you really understand your solution and that it will work for more than one case. 
  - Don’t forget to look for corner cases and edge cases and do any examples for those kind of cases you can think of.
  - > “Nothing can be automated that cannot be done manually!”

- Optimize the manual steps.
  - figure out if there is another way you can solve the problem easier, or if there are some steps you can cut our or simplify.

- Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
  - capture all the steps we created and now either put them into our editor as comments or write them as psuedo-code that we can translate to real code

- Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
  - 1 for 1 translation of the comments we created above for real code.

- Optimize the real code.
