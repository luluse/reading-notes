# Data Modeling & NoSQL Databases

### Why would a developer choose to make data models?
### What purpose do CRUD operations serve?
### What kind of database is Postgres? What kind of database is MongoDB?
### What is Mongoose and why do we need it?
### Define three related pieces of data in a possible application. An example for a store application might be Product, Category and Department. Describe the constraints and rules on each piece of data and how you would relate these pieces to each other. For example, each Product has a Category and belongs in a Department.

### database
organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system.Typically modeled in rows and columns in a series of tables to make processing and data querying efficient. The data can then be easily accessed, managed, modified, updated, controlled, and organized.

### data model 
A data model documents and organizes data, how it is stored and accessed, and the relationships among different types of data. 

### CRUD
When building APIs, we want our models to provide four basic types of functionality: Create, Read, Update, and Delete.

### schema
A database schema represents the logical configuration of all or part of a relational database.

### sanitize
means removing vulgarities & odd symbols from text, also removing potentially damaging contents to avoid intrusion attempts.

### Structured Query Language (SQL)
SQL is a programming language used by nearly all relational databases to query, manipulate, and define data, and to provide access control. 
- [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/database/what-is-database.html)

### Non SQL (NoSQL)
non-relational database. They provide flexible schemas and scale easily with large amounts of data and high user loads.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained)

### MongoDB
MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, meaning fields can vary from document to document and data structure can be changed over time

### Mongoose
### record
### document
### Object Relation Mapping (ORM)
