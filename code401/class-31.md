# Hooks API

## Why do we not need more .html pages in a multi-page React app?

React is using reusable component that are appended to the DOM. When a second page is create on a website, only components related to that page are loaded through the router. the website doesn't need a second html page.  

## If we wanted a component to show up on every page, where would we put it and why?
- Outside the `<BrowserRouter/>`
- Inside the `<BrowserRouter />`, outside a `<Route />`
- Inside a `<Route />`

We would tha component outside the `<BrowserRouter/>` because we want to app component to render it, not a particular route.

## What does props.children contain?

it is used to display whatever you include between the opening and closing tags when invoking a component.
