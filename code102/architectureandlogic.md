# How do computers work?

## What makes a computer, a computer?

A computer is a machine designed to manipulate information. 

4 tasks common to all computers: 
- Input information
- store information
- process it
- output the results

More precisely, a computer is a device that take input information and convert this physical info to binary information.

Memory stores the information.

Central processing unit processes information.

Output devices take that information and convert it into physical information.

types of input: 
keypad of computer
touchpad of phone
camera
microphone
gps

Output device:
screen
speaker
3D printer

## How does input travel into computer?
- physical info is converted into a number
- number sent as binary into computer
- cpu start to calculate how to display this info 
- Store the results into memory
- output device converts binary signals into physical information

The more information, the more memory and processing power a computer needs.

Every input or output from a computer is a type of information that can be represented by ON and OFF electric signal or 1 and 0 called binary system.

## Hardware and software
Hardware is your physical computer.

Software is all of the computer programs and code running on the machine.

How do they interact?

CPU is the master chip that control all the other parts of the computer. inside it has:
- circuits to do math and logic
- circuits to send and receive info to and from different parts of the computer.

Inside every computer there is an Operating system (the master program) that manages how software uses the hardware of the computer.
Software is a serie of commands maid of simple binary codes.
