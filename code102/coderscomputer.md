A terminal is a text based interface to the system where you can type in commands.

### Basic navigation:
Many tasks rely on being able to get to, or reference the correct location in the system.

- pwd (Print Working Directory) tells you where you are.

THere a two types of path we can use to refer to a file or a directory:

1. Absolute path begins with a forward slash ( / ). A file or directory location in relation to the root of the file system.

2. Relative path does not begin with a slash. A file or directory location relative to where we currently are in the file system.
