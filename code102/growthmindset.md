## Growth Mindset

After reading [this article](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/inside-atlassian/growth-mindset), I think that having a growth mindset means that you’re willing to learn and improve yourself and your skills everyday.

### To keep yourself in a growth mindset:
- **Don’t be afraid of challenges.** To grow, you must get out of your comfort zone.
- **Search for feedbacks and mentors** to lead you on the right path.
- It’s ok to make mistakes and fail as long as you **don’t give up.**
