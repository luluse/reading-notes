Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add style to plain text on Github. You can do simple formating like bold or italic text but also create lists or add links and pictures to your text using simple non-alphabetical characters. 

For example: to create a heading, you can use a hashtag before your phrase (e.g., # Heading One). Or to make a phrase bold, you add two asterisks before and after it (e.g., **this text is bold**).

Here is a list of some Markdown syntax that can be used on Github:

Headings:
# This large heading is my page title 
## The heading is for sections
###### The smallest heading and itâ€™s used for hints or notes

Styling text:
**This is bold text**
*This text is italicized*

Github pages help you easily put a website online and share your projects without having to do a lot of coding.  You can quickly get content online and stylize it with markdown. Github pages also support bigger projects where you can upload your files to Github so everyone can see them.
